// NewOutboundJSONBody wraps the already-marshaled upstream request body into a
// BodyStorage. When disk cache is enabled and the payload exceeds the configured
// threshold, the data is written to a temp file and the original []byte can be
// GC'd, significantly reducing the heap residency while waiting for the
// upstream provider to respond (the dominant cost for large base64 payloads).
//
// In memory mode the underlying memoryStorage reuses the same backing array,
// so this is equivalent to bytes.NewReader(data) in terms of memory usage.
//
// The caller MUST invoke closer.Close() once the upstream call has finished
// (typically via defer) to release the disk file / memory accounting.
//
// The returned reader is wrapped with common.ReaderOnly to prevent the HTTP
// transport from prematurely closing the underlying BodyStorage. The returned
// size and getBody are meant to be propagated to http.Request because the
// type-erased io.Reader prevents net/http from deriving either automatically.
